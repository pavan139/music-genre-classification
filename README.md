# music-genre-classification

### Abstract
Music has a significant impact on people's lives. It brings people together who share similar interests, and it is the glue that bonds communities together. Music genres are labels created by humans that identifies the category of music. Music genre classification is one of the most popular machine learning applications. In this project, out of many algorithms we tested and analyzed, we found accurate results in these two following models: 1. XGBoost technique 2. Convolutional Neural Networks. Both the classifiers gave noteworthy results with great accuracy and least margin of error. Which suggests it can be used on real world data as well.

### Quick Start
1. Clone the code into your local machine and extract it.
