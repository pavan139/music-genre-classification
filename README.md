# Music Genre Classification

### Project Description
This repository contains a music genre classification project that utilizes machine learning techniques to accurately identify music genres. We have tested and analyzed various algorithms, and found that the following two models provide the most accurate results:

1. XGBoost
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

These classifiers demonstrate high accuracy and low margin of error, making them suitable for real-world data applications.

### Motivation
Music has a significant impact on people's lives, serving as the glue that bonds communities together. Music genre classification is a popular machine learning application, as it automates the process of labeling music by genre. This project aims to provide an efficient and reliable solution for genre classification using advanced machine learning techniques.

### Environment Setup
Anaconda Installation
Go to the Anaconda.com/downloads site.
Select the respective platform: Windows/Mac/Linux.
Download the .exe installer.
Open and execute the .exe installer.
Launch Anaconda Navigator.
Click on the Install Jupyter Notebook Button.
Upon installation, open Jupyter Notebook.
Python Libraries Installation
Open the Anaconda console and install the following libraries:

```shell
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install keras
    conda install -c conda-forge xgboost
    pip install librosa
    pip install pydub
    pip install seaborn
```


### Quick Start
Clone the repository into your local machine and extract it.
Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification "Kaggle") and extract it.
Place the downloaded "Dataset" folder into the music-genre-classification-main folder.
Open the Jupyter Notebook environment and open music-genre-classification.ipynb.
Run all code cells in the notebook.
### Results
XGBoost outperforms CNN with an accuracy of 87% for the XGBoost model and 72% for the CNN model.
